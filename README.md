# C++ Range

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whoshuu/cpp_range.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whoshuu/cpp_range)

Have your cake and eat it too. Who says you can't have nice things in an efficient, type-safe, compiled language? Don't let your Python coworkers have the last laugh, this is C++ Range:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "range.h"

using namespace whoshuu;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    for (auto i : range(100)) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 0 to 99
    }

    for (auto i : range(10, 100)) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 10 to 99
    }

    for (auto i : range(10, 0, -1) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 10 to 1, counting down
    }

    for (auto i : range(2.718, 100.0, 3.14) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 2.178 to 96.918, by increments of Ï€, yum!
    }
}
```

## Benchmarks

Work in progress

## Install

Just throw the header into your project, be wary of the `whoshuu` namespace, and let it rip!

## Requirements

The only explicit requirement is a C++11 compatible compiler such as clang or gcc. The minimum required version of gcc is unknown, so if anyone has trouble using library with a specific version of gcc, do let me know.
